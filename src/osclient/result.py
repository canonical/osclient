"""The typed result every osclient call returns.

A call returns either a :class:`Success` carrying ``data`` or a :class:`Failure`
carrying a ``reason``; :data:`OpensearchResult` is the union of the two, and both
expose ``ok`` / ``data`` / ``reason`` / ``status`` so a result reads as a single
type (each field's meaning is documented on the two classes). A result is truthy
when it succeeded, so ``if res:`` (or ``if not res:``, ``assert res``) both
branches and narrows ``data`` to be present; you can also pattern-match on
``Success`` / ``Failure``. An expected failure (HTTP error, transport error, bad
JSON) is a value here, not a raised exception.
