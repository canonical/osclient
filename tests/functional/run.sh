# Run the osclient functional tests against an ephemeral Docker OpenSearch.
#
# The same script is used locally and in CI so the two behave identically: it
# starts a single-node OpenSearch, waits for it to answer, runs the tests through
# tox, then removes every resource it created. Data lives in the container's
# writable layer and the teardown runs on every exit path, so a run leaves no
# trace on the host.
#
# Environment variables:
#   KEEP_IMAGE=1  Keep the pulled image after the run (default; faster local
#                 iteration). Set to 0 to delete it on teardown.
#
# Requirements: docker (with the compose plugin), curl, openssl, and tox.
